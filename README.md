Design Approach and Skills
How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by first understanding the problem or requirement thoroughly. I then break down the project into smaller, manageable components and create a plan or flowchart to visualize the structure and flow of the software.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working on this project helped me develop skills in applying textures and materials, enhancing the visual appeal and realism of 3D scenes. I also learned how to use blending functions effectively to create transparency effects.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
For this project, I started with a clear concept and layout. I created rough sketches of the scene, identified the necessary components, and outlined the steps for modeling, texturing, and lighting. I then iteratively refined each part, ensuring they fit together seamlessly.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The tactics of breaking down tasks, iterative refinement, and focusing on realism can be applied to future projects. This structured approach ensures that complex projects are manageable and that the end result is polished and realistic.

Development Approach and Strategies
How do I approach developing programs?
I develop programs by starting with a clear understanding of the requirements, followed by planning the structure and flow of the code. I write modular code, testing each part individually before integrating them into the larger system.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used new strategies such as shader programming for realistic textures and blending techniques for transparency. I also focused on optimizing the rendering process to ensure smooth performance.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was crucial in my development process. I repeatedly tested and refined each component, from modeling to texturing to lighting. This iterative approach allowed me to identify and fix issues early, leading to a more polished final product.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach evolved to include more thorough planning and testing phases. I learned to value iterative refinement and modular coding, which made debugging easier and the overall development process more efficient.
